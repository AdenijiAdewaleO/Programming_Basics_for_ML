    "\n",
    "One of the most important words in computer science is \"if\", which allows us to make a conditional statement. An if statement is a command that allows us to:\n",

    "### Boolean Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements depend on booleans, or true false values. True and False are both keywords in Python that we can use for boolean operations, which are really common in programming. The actual conditions that we test can be almost anything - comparing numbers, checking if an email address is valid, or seeing if a password is correct - the key is that whatever the condition is, it must be able to be evaluated as true or false.\n",

    "#### Complex Boolean Operations\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we want to print out a line if a value is between num1 and num3 from above? We need to test two things, greater than num1 and less than num3. We can do that in two different ways, depending on what makes more sense to you - a compound equation or a series of simple if statements. "

    "#### Testing and Edge Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional operations, particularly ones with complex logic, are a prime candidate for introducing a bug into your code. The most likely place to have an error are the edge cases, or things along the limits of what can happen. For our simple number comparisons we'd want to test things like if numbers are equal to ensure it works as expected. We'd also want to make sure we test each correct scenario, when the tested number is lower than both, higher than both, and in the middle. For complex conditional logic this can expand to a pretty large number of potential cases to test, it is worth it to do so in most cases because these are the places where errors are likely to happen, and with things like this it may work perfectly for long periods of time until you get some unlikely edge case that fails or seems correct but has the wrong result.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes an edge case is highly situation dependent, but we probably want to ensure we test things at either side and equal to limits, empty values, 0 or negative values, incorrect data (e.g. letters in a phone number), equality in conditionals, repeated values, empty lists, or whatever else might be used in a logical statement in code. It's common for production software development have a test harness that is automatically run any time some portion of the code is updated. For example, if some programmer is working on some code that calculates grade point averages in our school example, when they submit their updates to be added to the main program, a series of tests may run to calculate some GPAs and some edge cases - GPA for no classes, average of 0, average over 4, \"IP\" (in progress, used if someone is given extra time after the end of a semester, like if they have surgery on Dec 1) to ensure the result was ok for all these things that might happen. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we want to setup tests for each potential outcome, values on the decision boundary, as well erroneous values that may be likely to occur. In  "
