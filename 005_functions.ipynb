    "# Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are something we've been using all along, they allow us to write a generic block of code that can be reused for all kinds of different purposes. If we write code to add tax to a sale, combine first and last names, or convert between inches and cm, the actual functionality of that code is always the same, just with different details, or inputs. A function allows us to write all the generic code that is ready to accept inputs, does it's job, and spits out an output. \n",

    "## Defining Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a function is pretty simple, there are a few things we need to think of:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Function name - as with variables, we want a name that makes sense. The name can be almost anything, but we want it to make sense. </li>\n",
    "<li> Inputs/Arguments - these are the values that are supplied by the person <i>using</i> the function.</li> This changes (potentially) every time the function runs. \n",
    "<li> Body - the code that we want to reuse over and over.</li>\n",
    "<li> Output/Return Value - this is the value that the function \"returns\" or the end result. Not every function needs to return a value, some just do stuff. </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a function to add the tax to a price, or parts break down as:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Function name - addTax. </li>\n",
    "<li> Arguments - the price of the object and the tax rates. These things can change to anything. </li>\n",
    "<li> Body - calculate the tax and new price. </li>\n",
    "<li> Return value - the newly calculated total price.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to define our function first, then we can use it. "
